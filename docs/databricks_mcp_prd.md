# Product Requirements Document: Databricks MCP Server

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Databricks Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server. The server will act as a standardized interface, enabling AI agents and applications (MCP Hosts/Clients) to interact securely and efficiently with Databricks workspaces, leveraging its capabilities for data management, AI/ML development, and workspace operations.

## 2. Goals

*   **Enable Agent Interaction:** Allow AI agents to programmatically interact with Databricks resources and APIs via the MCP standard.
*   **Standardized Access:** Provide a consistent and discoverable interface to key Databricks functionalities.
*   **Secure Operations:** Ensure all interactions adhere to Databricks security and governance models (authentication, permissions).
*   **Extensibility:** Design the server to be easily extendable to support new Databricks features and APIs as they become available.
*   **Developer Experience:** Provide a clear way for developers to understand and utilize the MCP server's capabilities.

## 3. Use Cases

*   **Agent-driven Development:** An agent uses the MCP server to create/modify Databricks notebooks, run code cells, manage libraries, and interact with Git repositories within Databricks.
*   **Data Retrieval & Analysis:** An agent queries database schemas, retrieves table previews, executes SQL queries, and fetches data summaries via the MCP server.
*   **AI/ML Workflow Management:** An agent uses the server to list MLflow experiments, retrieve run details, register models, trigger model training jobs, or query deployed model endpoints.
*   **Workspace Management:** An agent lists clusters, checks cluster status, lists jobs, retrieves job run details, or manages workspace files.
*   **RAG Implementation:** An agent uses the server to interact with Databricks Vector Search to index or query documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation tasks.

## 4. Functional Requirements

The MCP server must expose Databricks functionalities through the standard MCP capabilities: Tools, Resources, and Prompts. Authentication with the Databricks workspace is a prerequisite for all operations.

### 4.1. Authentication

*   **REQ-AUTH-01:** The server MUST authenticate with the target Databricks workspace using standard Databricks authentication methods (e.g., Personal Access Tokens, OAuth, Service Principals). Configuration details should be securely managed.
*   **REQ-AUTH-02:** All subsequent API calls made by the server to Databricks MUST use the established authenticated context.
*   **REQ-AUTH-03:** The server MUST respect Databricks permissions; operations should fail gracefully if the authenticated principal lacks the necessary permissions.

### 4.2. MCP Capabilities

The server should implement the following capabilities, categorized by Databricks area:

#### 4.2.3. Data & SQL

*   **REQ-DATA-TOOL-01 (Tool):** `execute_sql`: Execute a SQL query against a specified SQL Warehouse or cluster.
*   **REQ-DATA-RES-01 (Resource):** `list_catalogs`: List available Unity Catalogs.

*   **REQ-DATA-RES-04 (Resource):** `get_table_schema`: Retrieve the schema definition for a specified table.
*   **REQ-DATA-RES-05 (Resource):** `preview_table`: Retrieve the first N rows of a specified table.

#### 4.2.4. AI & Machine Learning (Mosaic AI / MLflow)

*   **REQ-ML-RES-01 (Resource):** `list_mlflow_experiments`: List MLflow experiments.
*   **REQ-ML-RES-02 (Resource):** `list_mlflow_runs`: List runs for a given MLflow experiment.
*   **REQ-ML-RES-03 (Resource):** `get_mlflow_run_details`: Get parameters, metrics, and artifacts for a specific MLflow run.
*   **REQ-ML-RES-04 (Resource):** `list_registered_models`: List models registered in the MLflow Model Registry.
*   **REQ-ML-RES-05 (Resource):** `get_model_version_details`: Get details for a specific model version.
*   **REQ-ML-TOOL-01 (Tool):** `query_model_serving_endpoint`: Send data to a Databricks Model Serving endpoint and get predictions.
*   **REQ-ML-TOOL-02 (Tool - RAG):** `add_to_vector_index`: Add/update documents in a Databricks Vector Search index.
*   **REQ-ML-TOOL-03 (Tool - RAG):** `query_vector_index`: Query a Databricks Vector Search index.

#### 4.2.5. Jobs

*   **REQ-JOB-RES-01 (Resource):** `list_jobs`: List configured Databricks Jobs.
*   **REQ-JOB-RES-02 (Resource):** `get_job_details`: Get the configuration of a specific job.

### 4.3. Prompts

*   **REQ-PROMPT-01:** The server MAY define specific MCP Prompts to guide AI agents on how to effectively use complex tools or common workflows (e.g., a prompt template for reviewing code changes in a notebook).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-PERF-01:** The server should respond to MCP client requests in a timely manner. Latency should primarily be dictated by the underlying Databricks API call duration.
*   **NFR-SEC-01:** Authentication credentials must be stored and handled securely. No sensitive information should be logged unnecessarily.
*   **NFR-REL-01:** The server should handle potential Databricks API errors gracefully and report meaningful error messages back to the MCP client.
*   **NFR-MAINT-01:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and include unit/integration tests for maintainability.
*   **NFR-COMP-01:** The server must implement the MCP protocol specification correctly, supporting discovery and invocation via specified transports (e.g., stdio, HTTP/SSE).

## 6. Future Considerations

*   Support for additional Databricks APIs (e.g., Delta Sharing, detailed Governance controls).
*   More sophisticated prompt engineering examples.
*   Support for real-time notifications from Databricks (if feasible via APIs and MCP).
*   Integration with Databricks CLI configuration profiles.

## 7. Out of Scope

*   Providing a graphical user interface.
*   Managing Databricks user permissions (relies on existing Databricks setup).
*   Caching Databricks responses beyond what the MCP protocol might inherently support.
