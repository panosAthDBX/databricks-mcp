# Databricks MCP Server

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Databricks.

## Overview

This server allows AI agents and other applications compatible with MCP to leverage Databricks functionalities, including:

*   Workspace management (notebooks, files, repos)
*   Compute management (clusters)
*   Data interaction (SQL execution, catalog browsing)
*   AI/ML workflow management (MLflow, Model Serving, Vector Search)
*   Job execution

Refer to the [Product Requirements Document](docs/databricks_mcp_prd.md) for detailed features and the [Technical Architecture](docs/databricks_mcp_tech_arch.md) for design specifics.
